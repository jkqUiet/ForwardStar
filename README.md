# ForwardStar
Implemented Forward Star with BFS and Dikstra algorithm used for finding shortest distance between nodes.
Additional timers and counters enable comparing speed and efficiency of both algorithms.
Forward star structure is programmed Impliocitly causing slower speed but solving problem with allocating new memory during changes.
